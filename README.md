🏦 CodSoft Internship – Task 3
ATM Interface using Java

This repository contains Task 3 of my CodSoft Internship, which is an ATM Interface application developed using Core Java. The project simulates real-world ATM operations such as withdrawing money, depositing money, and checking account balance through a console-based menu system.

📌 Task Information

Internship Provider: CodSoft

Task Number: 3

Task Title: ATM Interface

Programming Language: Java

Application Type: Console-based

📝 Project Description

The ATM Interface project is designed to mimic basic banking operations. It uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to separate responsibilities between different classes, making the code clean, modular, and easy to understand.

The application allows the user to:

Deposit money into the account

Withdraw money from the account

Check the current balance

Exit the system safely

✨ Features

Object-Oriented Design using multiple classes

Secure balance handling with validation

Menu-driven user interface

Real-time balance updates

Input validation for deposits and withdrawals

Beginner-friendly and readable code

🧠 OOP Concepts Used

Encapsulation – Balance is private and accessed through methods

Abstraction – ATM operations abstract account details

Class & Object implementation

Method-based modular programming

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java

Core Java Packages:

java.util.Scanner
